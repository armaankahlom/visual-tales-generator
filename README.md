## Overview

Visual Tales Generator is an AI pipeline that transforms text into visuals. It leverages the OpenAI API, Flux Dev diffusion models, and LoRA fine-tuning techniques. The system processes JSON input, ensuring character consistency through natural language processing (NLP). Its model-agnostic architecture utilizes system prompts to generate stunning Pixar-style 3D storyboards via the Replicate API. This tool automates the visual storytelling process, making it easier for creators to bring their ideas to life.
